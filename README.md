# Market Microstructure: Quote Driven Markets
<p>In this project, I and my group select Unilever (UN) as our target firm. We then merge the trade dataset and the quote dataset for one trading day.
<p>We then classify the trades by implementing CLNV algorithm.
<p>Next, we compute teh proportion of trades inside quotes, outside quots, and at quotes.
<p>We then compute the daily weighted average effective spread.
<p>We then generate:
<br>- the effective spread
<br>- oder-flow imbalance time series
<p>We also replicate the US NBBO system.
